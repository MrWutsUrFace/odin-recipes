        <h4>A simple and sweet burger with a taco taste...Taco Tuesday?</h4>
        <p>There's truly not much to say about this burger...It's a pretty normal burger <em>except</em> it has a <strong>taco</strong> like taste with it.</p>
        
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) package of taco seasoning</li>
            <li>3 <em>thick boy</em> slices of Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>3 hamburger buns, split</li>
        
        <h5>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix ground beef and taco seasoning together in a bowl.
                    Set in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to let taco
                    mix infuse into the beef.
                </li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly
                    oil the grate.
                </li>
                <li>Remove meat from the refrigerator and make 6 very thin
                    patties. Place a slice of Cheddar cheese into the center
                    of 3 patties. Place the remaining patties on top of the
                    cheese patties and seal together by pinching the ends.
                </li>
                <li>Cook on the preheated grill for 6 to 7 minutes.
                    Flip and continue cooking until no longer pink, 
                    6 to 7 minutes more. Place on hamburger buns.
                </li>
                <li><strong>ENJOY!</strong></li>
